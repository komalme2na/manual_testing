# 🧪 Manual Testing Portfolio – Page Language Model (PLM)

Hi! I'm Komal Meena , a Manual Tester Intern passionate about quality assurance, user experience, and test design. This project is part of my portfolio to demonstrate my skills in **manual testing**, including test planning, case design, documentation, and exploratory validation.

## 📌 Project Overview

This repository is based on the **Page Language Model (PLM)** – a format for describing the structure and flow of web/mobile applications in a way that's readable by both humans and AI agents.

I’ve customized this project to showcase how a **Manual Tester** would approach:

- Designing test scenarios using example app flows
- Validating key UI elements and interactions
- Creating a basic test plan for real-world components
- Enhancing documentation to reflect real QA contributions
